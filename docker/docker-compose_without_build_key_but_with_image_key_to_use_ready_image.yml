        # up completely in the running container as well.
        # So let's use command below to ping and only start our server (npm start) when the database is ready.
        # Having the server Dockerfile already run the CMD [ "npm", "start" ] is not a problem. The command here will
        # just overrride the CMD in the Dockerfile: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#command
        # This way we can still startup the server standalone, without docker-compose.
